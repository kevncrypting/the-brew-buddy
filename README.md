The Brew Buddy is the ritualistic coffee drinker's morning companion. As a brew buddy, it provides a handy aide for experimenting with new AeroPress coffee brewing recipes via a randomizer for each aspect of the brewing process. As a brew book, it provides a space for users to engage in a daily journaling exercise, centered around the period of time during which coffee is consumed.
